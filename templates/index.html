<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello, and welcome!</p>

<p>
I created this website because I wanted a little place where a few friends could
share songs with each other. There are lots of <em>big</em> places for this
already of course, but they all feel so noisy and cold and impersonal to me.  I
figure maybe some of you also feel the same way, so I made this little song
place just for us.
</p>

<p>
At present it's very basic - you can listen to the newest songs here on the
home page, or go to someone's profile to listen to all of their music.
If you encounter a bug or have ideas for things that would make the site
better, I'm open to any thoughts or feedback you have!  Just send me
(cfulljames) a message on Discord or email
<a href="mailto:littlesongplace@gmail.com">littlesongplace@gmail.com</a>. :)
