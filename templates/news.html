<h1>Site News</h1>

<h2>2025-02-01 - Comments!</h2>
<p>
The first big update!  A whole bunch of stuff has changed, but the biggest
feature by far is the new comment system.  You can now comment on songs, reply
to comments, edit those comments, and see the latest comments on your songs on
the new Activity page.  Go say nice things about people's songs!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comments, replies, and a new Activity page to show the newest comments on your songs</li>

    <li>Song descriptions can now contain multiple lines and HTML formatting (including links!)</li>
