<h2>2025-07-01 - Layout Tweaks</h2>
<p>A couple layout tweaks to help usability:</p>
<ul>
    <li>New sticky sidebar on big screens for navigation</li>
    <li>Song lists now look more consistent across screen sizes</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-06-27 - (Maintenance Patch)</h2>
<p>Just another bug fix &#x1fab2;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed: Player colors would sometimes get out of sync with page colors on iOS</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-06-26 - (Maintenance Patch)</h2>
<p>
Whoa, I can't believe the last update was two months ago!
I've been hard at work on some big changes over on the
development branch, but figured I'd merge in these bug
fixes in the meantime.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed: Refreshing the page, clicking a link, and then navigating back would show the pre-refresh page</li>
    <li>Fixed: The volume slider could get out of sync after a refresh</li>
    <li>Fixed: The music would pause or stutter whenever a key was pressed</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-04-26 - little song jam</h2>
<p>
Get ready!  The little song jam is coming soon!  I've been hard at work building
the new jam system for the site, and it's finally done.  More details to come!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>New <a href="/jams/1">jam page</a>!</li>
    <li>New fonts</li>
    <li>Lots of visual tweaks</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-04-06 - Open Source</h2>
<p>
littlesong.place is now open source!  Check out what I'm up to, open issues for
new features or bugs, comment on existing ones, and peruse the source code on
<a href="https://github.com/cfulljames/littlesongplace">the GitHub page</a>.
I've spent the last couple weeks cleaning up the code to make it
semi-presentable, and hopefully also easier to maintain going forward.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>New <a href="/about">About page</a></li>
    <li>Minor home page tweaks</li>
    <li>Minimize player when scrolling</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-03-23 - More Comments!</h2>
<p>
You can now leave comments on profiles and playlists!  I've spent the last
couple weeks rewriting the entire comment system on the server.  Before,
comments were tied directly to songs.  This was nice and simple, but it made it
impossible to add comments to anything else.  The new system is way more
flexible, and makes it much easier to add comment threads in new places.  If
everything worked correctly, all the existing song comments and notifications
should be seamlessly copied over to the new system as if nothing ever happened.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Profiles and playlists now have their own comment sections</li>
    <li>Fixed some minor navigation bugs</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-03-16 - (Maintenance Patch)</h2>
No new features today, just a couple small fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Adding a song to a playlist no longer refreshes the page</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where scroll position was maintained after clicking a link</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-03-01 - Increased Entropy</h2>
<p>
Normally programming is about bringing order to chaos, but this week I've
added chaos to your song order.  There's a new Random page that will randomly
select 50 songs from the database, and every song list now has a shuffle button
to randomize the song order.  You can even shuffle the songs on the Random page
for maximum chaos.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>New Random songs page</li>
    <li>Song lists now have a shuffle toggle</li>
    <li>The player stops playing at the end of the song list instead of looping forever</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-02-22 - Musical Continuity</h2>
<p>
The song player now persists between pages as you navigate around the site, so
the music isn't interrupted when you comment on a song or visit someone's
profile! It will continue playing the songs from the original page until you
click the play button on a new song.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Persistent audio player</li>
    <li>Profile links on the home page now use profile pictures and colors</li>
    <li>General visual cleanup for song lists and player</li>
    <li>You can now click the song title in the player to go to the song page</li>
    <li>Many text buttons have been replaced with icons</li>
    <li>Profile colors are now used on more profile-adjacent pages</li>
    <li>Revamped song view page</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-02-16 - Playlists</h2>
<p>
Do you need specific songs in a specific order?  Have I got the feature for
you! Create the perfect road trip playlist, DJ your nephew's birthday party, or
organize your songs into albums.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Playlists!</li>
    <li>Profile colors now also apply to individual songs and playlists</li>
    <li>On PC, you can use the left and right arrow keys to jump forward/back 10 seconds while a song is playing</li>
    <li>The upload date is now displayed in song details</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-02-08 - Profile Update & YouTube Importer</h2>
<p>
Make your profile your own by uploading a slick PFP and selecting custom
colors!  And now you can import songs directly from YouTube - just paste the
video URL into the upload form.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Profile pictures</li>
    <li>Profile color customization</li>
    <li>YouTube Importer</li>
    <li>Hopefully fixed rendering glitches in iOS Safari - only time will tell :/</li>
    <li>A few tweaks to the song player aesthetics</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-02-01 - Comments!</h2>
<p>
The first big update!  A whole bunch of stuff has changed, but the biggest
feature by far is the new comment system.  You can now comment on songs, reply
to comments, edit those comments, and see the latest comments on your songs on
the new Activity page.  Go say nice things about people's songs!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comments, replies, and a new Activity page to show the newest comments on your songs</li>
    <li>Color palette update (I'll admit, the old background was too yellow even for me, a proud yellow enjoyer)</li>
    <li>Song descriptions can now contain multiple lines and HTML formatting (including links!)</li>
    <li>
        Better support for audio playback on mobile:
        <ul>
            <li>Song title and artist should show up on your lock screen</li>
            <li>You can now skip to the next/previous track from your lock screen player</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Volume control on desktop</li>
    <li>Song details are expanded by default when viewing a single song</li>
    <li>Tons of minor tweaks and improvements to the look and feel of the site</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025-01-26 - Improved media format support</h2>
<p>
The song upload form now supports just about any audio format you can imagine!
It will even extract audio from video files automagically.
</p>

<h2>2025-01-25 - Launch day!</h2>
<p>
A few minor tweaks right out of the gate!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added site news!</li>
    <li>You can now click a song title to get a direct link for the song</li>
    <li>A much needed visual contrast bump</li>
    <li>Song lists now look way better on mobile</li>
</ul>
